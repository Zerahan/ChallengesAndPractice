Player
√	3 inventory slots
√		G to drop
		F to place/use
√	sanity level
√	sanity level drops while further than 400 units from all active light sources, includes a trace check for blocking walls.
		Should probably replace with a simple "is any lightswitch for this room powered on" check.
√	Rooms

√	Circuit breaker
√	Circuitbreaker can turn on/off
√	Circuitbreaker Informs director of it's state when it is changed
√	If there are multiple circuit breakers for a map, the director randomly picks one and deletes the rest.
√	Director updates all lights when Circuitbreaker changes state
√	Lightswitches
√	Lightswitch can turn on/off
√	Lightswitch controls visibility of multiple lights
√	Lights flicker when director says a hunt is happening
√	Doors exist
√	Doors swing by holding Use on them and moving
√	Doors can be "closed"

Equipment:
√	Flashlight
√		Flickers if ghost is in hunt mode
√	Thermometer
√		Every 1 second, does trace forward. If it hits, does a sphere trace on that point that can hit rooms. Displays that room's temperature with a margin of error of +-2.
√	Ghost writing
√		If the director says the ghost responds to this: If collids with the ghost *or* the ghost's room, has a chance of being written in.
√	EMF Reader
√		Collides with EMF event spheres.
√	Video Camera
√		Has two modes: normal and night-vision. Night-Vision mode can see ghost orbs
√		Maybe uses post-processing and a render material?
√	UV Light
√		Illuminates fingerprints
	Spirit Box
		voice recognition?

Director
√	Picks a random room to spawn the ghost in
√	Picks a random type for the ghost to be
√		Type determines what evidence gets a feedback
	If SpiritBox is evidence:
		Selects a random 5 questions from each category that can be responded to.
	ActiveLevel:
		Slowly increases over time. Also increases when around player or from player-caused events. Used to determine things like EMF 5, ghost writing, spirit box, etc.
√	IsHuntActive:
		Determines behavior of hunt timer.
	HuntTimer:
		When a hunt will end or when a hunt will start
		If hunt ends, sets timer to Time + HuntCooldown
		If hunt starts, sets timer to Time + HuntDuration
	HuntCooldown:
		30 seconds +-10. Demon Defaults to 15 +-5
	TargetPlayer:
		Defaults to random selection on hunt start. Banshee only changes this when the target is dead.

√GhostType
√	DisplayName
√	Evidence: Enum flags
	HuntCooldown
		Defaults to 30, Demon sets to 15
	HuntCooldownMargin
		Defaults to (-10,10), Demon sets to (-5,5)
	HuntDuration
		Defaults to 30
	HuntCooldownMargin
		Defaults to (0,20)
	HuntTargeting
		Defaults to ClosestFirst + ChangeOnHunt + ChangeOnDeath. Banshee turns off ChangeOnHunt
√	Temperature
√		Defaults to 5C, Banshee/Demon/Mare/Phantom/Wraith/Yurei sets to -10C
	LightBehavior
		Defaults to Uncaring. Mare sets to PreferOff. Jin sets to PreferOn.
		Used to determine what happens when a CircuitBreaker event is triggered.
	WalkSpeed (only used during hunt)
		Revenant defaults to faster
	WalkSpeedBehavior (only used during hunt)
		Defaults to Unchanged, Jinn sets to FurtherFaster
√	EventChance:
√		DoorEvent - Fingerprints makes this more likely
√		LightSwitchEvent - Fingerprints makes this more likely. Outcome determined by LightBehavior
√		WindowEvent - Fingerprints makes this more likely
√		PhysicsEvent - Phantom makes this more likely
√		CircuitBreakerEvent - Mare makes this more likely
√		GhostSpawnEvent - Mare/Yurei makes this more likely. A smudged Yurei can only pick spawn room as target for wandering.

Evidence
√	EMF Event:
√		A sphere collider with an EMF level of 2-5. Spawns on moved doors, thrown objects, and by the ghost.
√	Temperature:
√		The room the ghost is in drops in temperature over time. Temperature rises to default if ghost is not present.
√	Ghost Orbs:
√		Particle System that is only visible to a camera that is in night-vision mode.
√	Ghost Writing:
√		Ghost behavior event that sets a book's "IsWrittenIn" flag if it's in the right room.
√	Fingerprints:
√		When a door, window, or light switch is interacted with by the right type of ghost, enables that object's "HasFingerprint" flag.
√		Only visible in UV light. If the flashlight drops a decal where it hits, can use that to overlap with the fingerprint decal for visibility?
	Spirit Box:
		If the ghost is in range, it can respond to a list of questions from voice recognition.

Ghost Event:
√	Door:
		If closed, is opened by an inch for 5 seconds, then slammed shut.
		If open, gets pushed slightly in a random direction.
√		Spawns emf 3 event.
√	Light Switch:
√		Spawns emf 2 event.
	Window:
		Makes sound.
		Spawns emf 2 event.
	Physics Object:
		Pushed in random direction (not up/down)
√		Spawns emf 3 event.
√	CircuitBreaker
√		Low chance
√		Toggles between on/off
		Mare ignores if turned off
		
√	Ghost Spawn:
		Maybe handles hunts?
√		Spawns EMF 4 event (or 5 if ghost type and activity level is right)
		If ghost invisible, picks a random room to travel to.
		If ghost visible, randomly picks staying put or moving to closest player (aka fake hunt)

Ghost
	Every time the hunt timer expires, it picks a player and attempts to attack
		If sanity is above 50, the hunt is exclusively a sanity drop on catching
		If sanity is below 50, hunt has an increasingly likely chance to be a lethal hunt or not happen at all
	Spawns in and walks to random room
	Cools off the room it's currently in
